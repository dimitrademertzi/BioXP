    "description": "Stilbenoids are a group of phenolic compounds, biosynthetically interrelated through their common origin from a C6-C2-C6 intermediate, such as resveratol found in grapes. Stilbenoids can also exist as glycosides (e.g., piceid). Combretastatins are potentially useful stilbenoid natural products with known antitumor activity. Diarylheptanoid is a compound group having phenyl rings at 1,7 positions of n-heptane (C6-C7-C6), such as curcumin found in the ginger family. [6]-Gingerol is a major active component of ginger and has diverse pharmacologic effects.",
