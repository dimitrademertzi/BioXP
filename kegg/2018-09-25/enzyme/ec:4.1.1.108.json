    "comment": "A pyridoxal 5'-phosphate protein. The enzyme, isolated from the the plant Petroselinum crispum (parsley), catalyses the production of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde directly from L-tyrosine. Tyramine is not formed as an intermediate. The enzyme has a low activity with L-dopa (cf. EC 4.1.1.107, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde synthase).",
