The recommended numbering of geraniol gives 8-hydroxygeraniol as the product rather than 10-hydroxygeraniol as used by references 1-3. See prenol nomenclature {iupac/misc/prenol#p1::Pr-1}. The cloned enzyme also catalysed, but less efficiently, the 3'-hydroxylation of naringenin (cf. EC 1.14.14.82, flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase) [3].",
