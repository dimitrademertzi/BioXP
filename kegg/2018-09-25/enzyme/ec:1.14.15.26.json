    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from several Pseudomonas strains, catalyses the first step in the degradation of toluenes and xylenes. It has a broad substrate specificity and is also active with substituted compounds, such as chlorotoluenes. The electrons are provided by a reductase (EC 1.18.1.3, ferredoxin---NAD+ reductase) that transfers electrons from NADH via FAD and an [2Fe-2S] cluster. The enzyme can also act on its products, producing gem-diols that spontaneously dehydrate to form aldehydes.",
