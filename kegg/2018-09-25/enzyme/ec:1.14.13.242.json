    "comment": "Contains FAD. The enzyme, characterized from the bacteria Pseudomonas sp. MA-1 and Mesorhizobium loti, participates in the degradation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Although the enzyme was initially thought to be a dioxygenase, oxygen-tracer experiments have shown that it is a monooxygenase, incorporating only one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen. The second oxygen atom that is incorporated into the product originates from a water molecule, which is regenerated during the reaction and thus does not show up in the reaction equation.",
