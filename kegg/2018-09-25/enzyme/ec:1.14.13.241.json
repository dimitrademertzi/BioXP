    "comment": "Contains FAD. The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Arthrobacter sp. Cr-7, participates in the degradation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Although the enzyme was initially thought to be a dioxygenase, oxygen-tracer experiments have suggested that it is a monooxygenase, incorporating only one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen into the product. The second oxygen atom originates from a water molecule, which is regenerated during the reaction and thus does not show up in the reaction equation.",
