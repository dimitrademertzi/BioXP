    "comment": "Abietic acid is the principle component of conifer resin. This enzyme catalyses the last step of the pathway of abietic acid biosynthesis in Abies grandis (grand fir). The activity has been demonstrated in cell-free stem extracts of A. grandis, was present in the cytoplasm, and required NAD+ as cofactor [1]. The enzyme is expressed constitutively at a high level, and is not inducible by wounding of the plant tissue [2].",
