    "comment": "A cytochrome P-450 (heme-thiolate) enzyme found in plants. The enzyme catalyses an oxidative reaction that does not incorporate oxygen into the product. Forms the methylenedioxy bridge of the protoberberine alkaloid (S)-nandinine by the oxidative ring closure of adjacent phenolic and methoxy groups of (S)-scoulerine. cf. EC 1.14.19.65, (S)-cheilanthifoline synthase, which catalyses a similar reaction at the other side of the (S)-scoulerine molecule, forming (S)-cheilanthifoline.",
