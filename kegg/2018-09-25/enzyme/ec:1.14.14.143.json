The conversion of substrate into product involves the hydroxylation of the syn-methyl (C9), intramolecular cyclization to the hemiketal and dehydration to the furan [1]. This is the second cytochrome P-450-mediated step of monoterpene metabolism in peppermint, with the other step being catalysed by EC 1.14.14.99, (S)-limonene 3-monooxygenase [1].",
