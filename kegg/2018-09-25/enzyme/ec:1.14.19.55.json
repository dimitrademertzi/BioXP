The enzyme, described from epiphytic marine bacteria of the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Marinomonas, is an unusual single-component FAD-dependent halogenase that contains a distinct NAD(P)H binding domain and does not require an additional flavin reductase for activity. The enzyme catalyses a bromination of its substrate, followed by a second bromination concurrent with decarboxylation.",
