    "comment": "This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of vindoline and vindorosine in the plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). In vivo, it functions in the direction of reduction. It has no activity with 3-epoxylated compounds, which can form spontaneously from its unstable substrates.",
