    "comment": "This microsomal cytochrome P-450 (heme-thiolate) enzyme is rather specific for (+)-marmesin, although it can also accept 5-hydroxymarmesin to a much lesser extent. Furanocoumarins protect plants from fungal invasion and herbivore attack. (+)-Columbianetin, the angular furanocoumarin analogue of the linear furanocoumarin (+)-marmesin, acts as a competitive inhibitor even though it is not a substrate.",
