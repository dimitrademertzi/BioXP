    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Streptomyces davawensis, has the activities of an oxidoreductase, a decarboxylase, and an aminotransferase. Its combined actions result in the replacement of a methyl substituent of one of the aromatic rings of FMN by an amino group, a step in the biosynthetic pathway of roseoflavin. The reaction requires thiamine for completion.",
